							<p>
                                At the heart of any good story is a well written character. They are ultimately the source 
                              for every emotion that is stirred. They stay with you long after you walk away. Superheroes
                              are no different. The ones that stick with us, that we yearn to adventure with again, that
                              we spend countless dollars keeping up with, become friends. They remind us of the people in 
                              our lives that we love and hate. They are who we strive to become. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Hero! is here to help you create just such a character. Here you'll have the opportunity to 
                                dive into the mind of your own hero. You'll be guided through the creation of a back story. 
                                You'll choose personality traits that range from heroic to villianous because even the best
                                of us is still far from perfect. You'll discover which skills your character is good at and 
                                which ones are their Achilles' heel. Finally, you'll dive into what makes them super. Pick 
                                powers, weapons, and gadgets before finishing out with supporting characters. 
                              </p>

                                In the end you'll be left with artwork generated by the choices you've made and a character
                                that is prepared for any story.
